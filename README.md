# ofmErrorReportingSystem
This system is created to let users easy report errors to contributors, via the trello board "Fir Status Tracking".

###How to test this app
Note: if you don't change anything app will work connected to my firebase.

If you want to connect it to another firebase account:

- Make your account in firebase
- Add web application to it
- In the "config.ts" file, change "fire" property to your's firebase info

You will need to copy current user's jwt for server side testing. (I console.logged it for you)

After that app is ready for testing.
